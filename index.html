    <p>Since 2011 I have worked as Director of Transportation at a local
      destination management company. In this role my major responsibilities
      centered around operations and management. During this time, however, I
      dabbled in a few side projects where I fumbled my way through building
      Wordpress sites. Despite the struggle, I loved the process of discovery
      and building something new. In 2018 I decided to delve deeper and began to
       teach myself, little by little, to program. However, this process,
       coupled with a full-time job, was slow and ambiguous. In order to expedite
        my learning I landed on DigitalCrafts to guide my way.</p>
    <p>Along with programming a few of my interests include...</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Music</li>
      <li>Gaming</li>
      <li>Spectator Sports</li>
      <li>Cooking</li>
      <li>Film and Television</li>
